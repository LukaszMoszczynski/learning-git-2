		<h1>Rainbow in the dark</h1>
		<h4>by Ronnie James Dio</h4>
		<p>
			When there's lightning
			You know it always brings me down
			'Cause it's free and I see that it's me
			Who's lost and never found

			I cry out for magic
			I feel it dancing in the light
			It was cold, lost my hold
			To the shadows of the night

			No sign of the mornin' comin'
			You've been left on your own
			Like a rainbow in the dark
			A rainbow in the dark
		</p>
		<p>
			Do your demons
			Do they ever let you go?
			When you've tried, do they hide deep inside?
			Is it someone that you know?

			You're just a picture
			You're an image caught in time
			We're a lie, you and I
			We're words without a rhyme

			There's no sign of the mornin' comin'
			You've been left on your own
			Like a rainbow in the dark
			Just a rainbow in the dark
			Yeah

			When I see lightning
			You know it always brings me down
			'Cause it's free and I see that it's me
			Who's lost and never found
