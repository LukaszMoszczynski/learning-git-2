		<h1>Rainbow in the dark</h1>
		<h4>by Ronnie James Dio</h4>
		<p>
			When there's lightning<br>
			You know it always brings me down<br>
			'Cause it's free and I see that it's me<br>
			Who's lost and never found<br>
			<br>
			I cry out for magic<br>
			I feel it dancing in the light<br>
			It was cold, lost my hold<br>
			To the shadows of the night<br>
			<br>
			No sign of the mornin' comin'<br>
			You've been left on your own<br>
			Like a rainbow in the dark<br>
			A rainbow in the dark
		</p>
		<p>
			Do your demons<br>
			Do they ever let you go?<br>
			When you've tried, do they hide deep inside?<br>
			Is it someone that you know?<br>
			<br>	
			You're just a picture<br>
			You're an image caught in time<br>
			We're a lie, you and I<br>
			We're words without a rhyme<br>
			<br>
			There's no sign of the mornin' comin'<br>
			You've been left on your own<br>
			Like a rainbow in the dark<br>
			Just a rainbow in the dark<br>
			Yeah<br>
			<br>
			When I see lightning<br>
			You know it always brings me down<br>
			'Cause it's free and I see that it's me<br>
			Who's lost and never found
		</p>
		<p>
			Feel the magic<br>
			I feel it floating in the air<br>
			But it's fear and you'll hear<br>
			It calling you beware<br>
			Look out<br>
			<br>
			There's no sight of the mornin' comin'<br>
			There's no sign of the day<br>
			You've been left on your own<br>
			Like a rainbow<br>
			Like a rainbow in the dark<br>
			Yeah, yeah<br>
			<br>
			You're a rainbow in the dark<br>
			Just a rainbow in the dark<br>
			No sign of the mornin'<br>
			You're a rainbow in the dark
